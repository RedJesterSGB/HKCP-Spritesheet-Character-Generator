 HKCP Spritesheet Generator
 =============================================

Originally based on [LPC Character generator](https://github.com/Gaurav0/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator).
This generator attempts to include all [LPC](https://lpc.opengameart.org) created art up to now.

Try it [here](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/).

The Liberated Pixel Effort is a collaborative effort from a number of different great artists who helped produce sprites for the project.
**If you wish to use LPC sprites in your project, you will need to credit everyone who helped contribute to the LPC sprites you are using.** See below for how to do this.
